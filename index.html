    <h1>Welcome to my CISS100 final project!</h1>
    <h2>These are all the things that I am interested. (As few as it may be)</h2>

    <p> For my CISS 100 final project I decided to take the skills I learned in the website design unit to make a website. I am really grateful for taking this CISS 100 class at Hudson Valley Community College because it gave me the opportunity to see if a computer science related career is something that I want, and it is not. The labs that we did in class were really fascinating because it was like puzzle in trying to figure out how to do the lab. However, I don't like sitting at a desk and will probably do something else for a job.</p>
    <p>The topics that interest me the most are related to mechanical, electrical, and science disciplines. These disciplines fascinate me because I can understand what is going on (for the most part). These also align with eventual projects that I would like to do and potential career paths. While a lot of the careers in these disciplines do require desk work, hopefully I won't be spending all my time at a desk. Some of my interests are:</p>
