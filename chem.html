    <p>There is so much that you can do in this field. From using microbes to turn poop into a usable form of biogas to the production of chemicals. In material science and engineering you get to find and develop ways to manufacture new alloy, ceramics, and understand the physics of chemical interactions. All of these are mazing because you are using the forces of nature to create new products and produce energy.</p>
