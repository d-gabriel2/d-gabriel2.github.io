    <p>Star Wars is great because of the vastness of the universe that has been created for it, telekinetic powers, epic duels, and the ability to explore the universe. I like Star Wars because of the story, cool characters, and that I can day dream about being in such a society far more advanced in technology to explore the solar system and galaxy. </p>
