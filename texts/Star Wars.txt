(title) Star Wars

(paragraph) Star Wars is great because of the vastness of the universe that has been created for it, telekinetic powers, epic duels, and the ability to explore the universe. I like Star Wars because of the story, cool characters, and that I can day dream about being in such a society far more advanced in technology to explore the solar system and galaxy.
