    <p>Agriculture is really important because it produces food, and one does really care about anything else if starving to death. Since agriculture now needs to producing more food for more and more people there are cool new technologies coming out to make good food for attainable. Like robots on the farm to milk cows and weed between crops. As well as hydroponics that can grow food year around in urban spaces. Agriculture is also cool because of the really really being tractors and equipment that you can use.</p>
